            </h2>
          <p>      Money was gold coin, a typical tactic of rulers.
            Rulers seeking to expand their political power have always needed more money.
            Creating a taxonomic category - let's say “money”.
            
            To appreciate the value of money's substitution as a medium of exchange and diagnosis as a means of justification, we must consider briefly the nature and functions of money. What is considered money? Webster's International Dictionary devotes the better part of two pages to the various meanings of the word “money,” and offers this as its primary meaning: Something generally accepted as a medium of exchange.

          <p>       In the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the definition of money exceeds five semicolons, the primary meaning of the word is given as: “Current coin; metal stamped into pieces of portable form as a medium of exchange and measure of value.” Difficulties with the descriptive definition of money forced economists to propose its functional definition.  “Money, - said the British economist Sir Ralph Hawley, - but these concepts ... are defined primarily by the use or purpose they serve.” In other words, money, regardless of its physical or legal characteristics, can be anything that functions as a device for exchange and measurement of wealth. The point is that money is neither a productive good like technology nor a consumer good like food; instead, it is a means of expressing relationships between different goods.</p>

            </h2>
          <p>Almost any object that people value, especially if it is scarce, may have served as a medium of exchange. In ancient times, such goods as salt, sugar, tobacco, oxen and slaves were used in this way. In Europe during and immediately after World War II, cigarettes were exchanged for food and other necessities. Some goods - today, so-called illegal drugs - often turn them into forms of (illegal) currency with profound social consequences. From early times, decorative, non-expendable goods, usually gold and silver, rather than useful consumer items, served as means of exchange. For most of history, money was minted coins made of gold, silver, or some base metal such as copper or nickel. Although the earliest use of paper money dates back to the second century BC. E. in China, its entry into the modern West is usually attributed to John Lowe, a colorful Scotsman perhaps best known as the architect of the infamous eighteenth-century frenzy, Mississippi (or Louisiana).</p>

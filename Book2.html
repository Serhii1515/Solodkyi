          <p>However, paper money did not become widely used only in the 19th century. Economists distinguish between currency (or hand-to-hand circulation, which includes coins and banknotes), cash equivalents (such as bank demand deposits and treasury bills), and goods used as money (such as gold or silver bullion or consumables such as tobacco). In modern industrial societies, coins and paper money make up only a small part of the country's total money supply, cash equivalents make up the majority of it. One of the characteristics of money is its connection with power, which is hinted at by the etymology of this term. The word comes from the Latin “Coin”, as in the name of the Roman goddess Juno Moneta, in whose temple on the Capitoline Hill coins were minted and kept. In Latin, monere means to teach or teach and monitus, a warning or admonition.  </p>

          <p>Indeed, it can be said that one of the main characteristics of money is that it is accepted as currency, a feature recognized by economists. To explain why money has value, they tell us, “it is necessary to introduce acceptability; that is, behavior”. These aspects emphasize its important functions as a medium of exchange between people and with whom it interacts (family, doctors, nurses, employers, insurance companies, lawyers, the state).</p>

          <p>Standards: Monetary and medium of exchange used as money is called "monetary standard". Such standards are of two types, commodity (precious metal) and non-commodity (paper, or so-called “fiat money”). The term “fiat money” comes from the Latin fiat “let there be”, as in Fiat lux (“Let there be light!”) in the Latin Bible. Fiat money is paper converted into money by decree of the state. The term “gold standard” refers to fixing the value of a unit of currency by tying it to a specified amount (weight) of gold. From the Middle Ages until World War I, gold-based currency, usually gold coins, was the norm. Non-metallic money was little used in Europe until the end of the 18th century. In the United States, gold coins and gold certificates ceased to function as legal tender in 1934. From the mid-1930s, virtually all governments adopted a fiat standard for their money, freeing them from any obligation to return the coins or notes to their owners in gold or silver.
